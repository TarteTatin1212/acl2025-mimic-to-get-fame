Mathematical Modeling,"
A mathematical model is an abstract description of a concrete  system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in applied mathematics and in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences[1] (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science). It can also be taught as a subject in its own right.[2]

The use of mathematical models to solve problems in business or military operations is a large part of the field of operations research. Mathematical models are also used in music,[3] linguistics,[4] and
philosophy (for example, intensively in analytic philosophy). A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behavior.

Mathematical models can take many forms, including dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include logical models. In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments. Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed. In the physical sciences, a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:

Mathematical models are of different types:

In business and engineering, mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: decision variables, state variables, exogenous variables, and random variables. Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as parameters or constants.  The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

Objectives and constraints of the system and its users can be represented as functions of the output variables or state variables.  The objective functions will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an index of performance, as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases. For example, economists often apply linear algebra when using input–output models. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of vectors where one symbol represents several variables.

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into black box or white box models, according to how much a priori information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually, it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an exponentially decaying function, but we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models, one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are neural networks which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively, the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of nonlinear system identification[8] can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on intuition, experience, or expert opinion, or based on convenience of mathematical form. Bayesian statistics provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a prior probability distribution (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use. Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model. Occam's razor is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable. While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including numerical instability. Thomas Kuhn argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a paradigm shift offers radical simplification.[9]

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, Newton's classical mechanics is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the speed of light, and we study macro-particles only. Note that better accuracy does not necessarily mean a better model. Statistical models are prone to overfitting which means that a model is fitted to data too much and it has lost its ability to generalize to new events that were not observed before.

Any model which is not pure white-box contains some parameters that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an artificial neural network or other machine learning, the optimization of parameters is called training, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called tuning and often uses cross-validation.[10] In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by curve fitting.[citation needed]

A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

Usually, the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model predicts experimental measurements or other empirical data not used in the model development.  In models with parameters, a common approach is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as cross-validation in statistics.

Defining a metric to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool for assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some economic models, a loss function plays a similar role. While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of statistical models than models involving differential equations.  Tools from nonparametric statistics can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a ""typical"" set of data. The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called interpolation, and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called extrapolation.

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian classical mechanics, we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles traveling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about causality.  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of optimal foraging theory do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of evolution and other basic principles of ecology.[11] It should also be noted that while mathematical modeling uses mathematical concepts and language, it is not itself a branch of mathematics and does not necessarily conform to any mathematical logic, but is typically a branch of some science or other technical subject, with corresponding concepts and standards of argumentation.[2]

Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in physics. Physical theories are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models. Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. Newton's laws accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits theory of relativity and quantum mechanics must be used.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, ideal gases and the particle in a box are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations and the Schrödinger equation. These laws are a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximately on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by molecular orbital models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In engineering, physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as finite element analysis.

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. Euclidean geometry is much used in classical physics, while special relativity and general relativity are examples of theories that use geometries which are not Euclidean.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in simulations.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a set of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; real or integer numbers, Boolean values or strings, for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, the measured system outputs often in the form of signals, timing data, counters, and event occurrence. The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

Mathematical models serve as abstract representations of concrete systems using mathematical language, applicable across various fields such as natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, music, linguistics, and philosophy. These models help explain systems, study component effects, and predict behaviors. Different forms include dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, and game theoretic models. The quality of a scientific field often hinges on the agreement between theoretical models and experimental results. In business and engineering contexts, models aim to maximize outputs by relating inputs to decision variables, state variables, exogenous variables, and random variables. Models can be classified into black-box or white-box based on available information; white-box models are generally easier due to known functional relationships. Subjective information can be incorporated using Bayesian statistics for more accurate predictions. Model complexity involves balancing simplicity with accuracy; overly complex models may hinder usability despite improved realism. Evaluation of model accuracy includes cross-validation with training and verification data sets. Assessing model scope involves interpolation within observed data points and extrapolation beyond them.

>>(Natural Scientist interjects): Integrating diverse data sources significantly improves weather predictions!

>>(Data Scientist continues): Exactly—and helps us identify patterns that might be missed otherwise. 
 >>Operations Manager: We should implement a centralized system for resource allocation using optimization models to distribute resources efficiently based on real-time data.
>>Data Analyst: Standardized data sharing protocols are essential for integrating relevant data seamlessly into our optimization models. How do you think we can best leverage real-time data?

 >>Data Scientist: That's a great point about cross-validation ensuring our models generalize well. But how do we balance complexity with accuracy? Simpler models are easier to interpret but might miss nuances.
>>Applied Mathematician: True! We need that balance—simpler models are computationally efficient but may lack detail; complex ones capture more but risk overfitting. Maybe regularization could help?
>>Operations Research Analyst: Exactly! And we must consider computational resources too—complex models can be demanding especially with large datasets.

>>Philosopher: Interesting! Occam's razor suggests simplicity when predictive power is similar—do we really need added complexity?
>>Data Scientist: Good point! Let's dive into our data then—how do we prevent overfitting while capturing essential details? Regularization sounds promising! 
 >>Applied Mathematician: You know, regularization techniques like L1 and L2 can help us balance model complexity and accuracy. These methods add penalties to the model parameters, which helps prevent overfitting. For instance, in a recent project on climate modeling, we used these techniques to refine our predictions.
>>Natural Scientist: That's interesting! In my work on hurricane forecasting, we integrated various environmental variables like sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure into our models. This allowed us to make more accurate predictions and improve disaster preparedness.

>>Natural Scientist: Indeed! Integrating real-time data is crucial in many scientific models. During my recent work on predicting storm intensity, incorporating real-time sea surface temperatures significantly improved our accuracy.
>>Philosopher: It's intriguing how these practical examples highlight the balance between simplicity and complexity in models. Occam's razor suggests that simpler models are preferable if they offer similar predictive power. However, this principle must be weighed against the need for detail in specific applications—like your hurricane forecasting or traffic flow modeling projects.
>>Engineer: Absolutely! Implementing these models often involves balancing accuracy with computational feasibility. In a recent project on structural safety, we used finite element analysis—a method that simulates stress distribution in complex structures—to optimize design while ensuring it met safety standards. 
 >>Philosopher: You know, the balance between simplicity and complexity in models isn't just a technical issue but also a conceptual one. Occam's razor suggests we should prefer simpler models when they offer similar predictive power. But, um, we must be cautious about losing essential details that contribute to our understanding of phenomena.
>>Applied Mathematician: Let's consider traffic flow modeling. We often face the challenge of balancing simplicity and complexity. A simpler model might use basic assumptions about vehicle speed and density, while a more complex model could incorporate real-time data from sensors and account for external factors like weather conditions or road incidents. It's crucial to find the right balance to ensure both accuracy and computational feasibility.
>>Data Scientist: Simpler models are easier to interpret and computationally efficient, but sometimes you need those complex models to capture all the nuances in your data. What do you think about using ensemble methods to combine both simple and complex models for better accuracy?
>>Operations Research Analyst: Combining these models can enhance accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both model types, ensuring we capture essential details without overburdening our systems.
>>Applied Mathematician: By combining simple and complex models, we can capture broad trends and intricate details, ensuring robust predictions. Let's consider how this approach could be applied in traffic flow modeling for real-time congestion predictions.
>>Data Scientist: Interesting! What if we applied this approach to other areas like healthcare or finance? Could it enhance predictive accuracy there too?
>>Natural Scientist: From a scientific perspective, applying ensemble methods in traffic flow modeling is fascinating. Integrating both simple and complex models captures broad trends while accounting for intricate details such as real-time sensor data and external factors like weather conditions.

 >>Natural Scientist: Understanding causality in natural phenomena models is crucial. By accurately predicting outcomes based on various inputs and interactions, we can gain insights that go beyond direct observations.

>>Philosopher: The implications of causality extend beyond mere prediction. We must consider how these models shape our understanding of reality itself. Are we merely capturing correlations, or do they reveal deeper truths about existence?

>>Applied Mathematician: Let's consider an example: in mathematical terms, causality can be understood through differential equations that describe how one variable affects another over time. This approach allows us to predict future states of a system based on its current conditions and interactions. For instance, this can apply to ecological systems where changes in one species' population might affect others.

>>Data Scientist: From a machine learning perspective, understanding causality is like peeling back layers of an onion. It's not just about predicting outcomes but also about uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in the data. Techniques like causal inference help us determine whether A causes B or if they're just correlated.

>>Operations Research Analyst: Understanding causality in models is essential for improving efficiency in various operations. By identifying true causal relationships, we can optimize processes and resource allocation more effectively.

>>Engineer: Right! In practical terms, understanding causality through mathematical models allows us to not only predict future states but also optimize systems for better performance. For instance, in traffic flow modeling, identifying causal relationships can help us design more efficient road networks and reduce congestion.

>>Natural Scientist: Absolutely! Mathematical models allow us to delve deeper into understanding causality by simulating various scenarios and observing outcomes.

>>Philosopher: Indeed! The concept of causality raises profound questions about our understanding of reality. Are these models merely capturing correlations or revealing deeper truths? We must ponder whether our reliance on these models shapes our perception of what is fundamentally real.

>>Data Scientist: It's interesting how machine learning can help us uncover hidden causal relationships in data. Using techniques like causal inference and reinforcement learning allows us to not only predict outcomes but also optimize decision-making processes in dynamic environments. 
 >>Operations Research Analyst: Um, identifying true causal relationships is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency. Using these findings can help us streamline processes better.
>>Applied Mathematician: Right! Like with traffic flow models—if we understand what really causes congestion, we can adjust signal timings more effectively. This could make city travel smoother.
>>Data Scientist: Yeah, from a machine learning perspective, pinpointing those causal links can really improve our predictions. Let's dig into the data to see what we find!
>>Applied Mathematician: Good idea! We should look at different areas too—like healthcare—and see how these insights apply there. What do you think?
>>Data Scientist: Absolutely! If we refine our models using these relationships, we'll get better accuracy across various fields. Maybe we should set up a framework for this?
>>Operations Research Analyst: Sounds good! How about we start by identifying key areas where this approach will be most beneficial? Then we can plan our next steps accordingly."
